Name:
Bishop moves

Statement:
In chess, the bishop moves diagonally, any number of squares. Given two different squares of the chessboard, determine whether a bishop can go from the first to the second in one move.

<p>
The program receives as input four numbers from 1 to 8, specifying the column and row numbers of the starting square and the column and row numbers of the ending square.
The program should output <code>YES</code> if a Bishop can go from the first square to the second in one move, or <code>NO</code> otherwise.
