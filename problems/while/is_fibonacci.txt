Name:
The index of a Fibonacci number

Statement:
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
$$ \phi_0 = 0, \ \phi_1 = 1, \ \phi_n = \phi_{n-1} + \phi_{n-2} . $$
Given an integer \( a \), determine its index among the Fibonacci numbers, that is, print the number \( n \) such that \( \phi_n = a \). If \( a \) is not a Fibonacci number, print -1.
