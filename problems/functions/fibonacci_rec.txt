Name:
Fibonacci numbers

Statement:
Given a non-negative integer \( n \), print the \( n \)th Fibonacci number.  Do this by writing a function <code>fib(n)</code> which takes the non-negative integer \( n \) and returns the \( n \)th Fibonacci number.

<p>Don't use loops, use the <i>flair</i> of recursion instead.
However, you should think about why the recursive method is much slower than using loops.
